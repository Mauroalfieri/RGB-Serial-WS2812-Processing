# RGB-Serial-WS2812-Processing

The RGB Serial WS2812 Processing interface allow to control a single or a strip of leds RGB WS2812 from a serial comunication:

At the start of the Processing software you're going to show this start image:

When you're going to move each color bar the value of the color change and it's going to send to Arduino sketch.

### Arduino Uno
The project is available on the arduino one board (and on all the other boards of the arduino family)

### Wemos ESP8266
The project is available on the ESP8266 only changing the board in the Arduino IDE -> Menu Tools -> Boards -> Wemos D1 Mini 

### Video Demo
You can see the video of the experiment on my [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtnlq-EDcvIA7MRL-Pn2jsg)
